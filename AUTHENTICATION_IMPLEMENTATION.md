### Database Integration

Your Neon database already has the `neon_auth.users_sync` table, which Stack Auth uses to sync user data. This allows you to:
- Query user information in your application
- Create relationships between users and analyses
- Maintain data consistency

## 📋 Setup Required

To activate authentication, you need to:

### 1. Create Stack Auth Account
Visit [Stack Auth](https://app.stack-auth.com/) and create a free account.

### 2. Create a Project
- Name: "VentureClone AI"
- Enable: Email/Password authentication

### 3. Get Your Credentials
Copy these three keys from your Stack Auth dashboard:
- Project ID
- Publishable Client Key
- Secret Server Key

### 4. Update Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:

```env
# Stack Auth Configuration
VITE_STACK_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
VITE_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY=your_publishable_key_here
STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

### 5. Configure Stack Auth Dashboard

**Allowed Domains:**
- `http://localhost:5000` (development)
- Your production domain

**Redirect URLs:**
- Sign In URL: `/handler/sign-in`
- Sign Up URL: `/handler/sign-up`
- After Sign In: `/home`
- After Sign Up: `/home`
- After Sign Out: `/`

### 6. Start Your App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` and you'll see the "Sign In" button!

## 🎯 User Flow

### New User Journey
1. User visits the app → Redirected to sign-in
2. Clicks "Sign Up" → Fills out email/password form
3. Receives verification email (if enabled)
4. Verifies email and signs in
5. Redirected to `/home` (dashboard)
6. Can access profile at `/profile`

### Returning User Journey
1. User visits the app → Redirected to sign-in
2. Enters credentials → Signs in
3. Redirected to `/home` (dashboard)
4. Session persists across browser sessions

### Authenticated User Features
