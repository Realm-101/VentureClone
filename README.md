```

### Performance Tuning

Key configuration options:

```typescript
// Timeout settings
const TIMEOUTS = {
  firstPartyExtraction: 8000,    // 8 seconds
  aiAnalysis: 15000,             // 15 seconds
  improvementGeneration: 30000   // 30 seconds
};

// Concurrency limits
const LIMITS = {
  maxConcurrentAnalyses: 5,      // Simultaneous requests
  htmlContentLimit: 2097152,     // 2MB HTML content
  responseLimit: 5242880         // 5MB response size
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Analysis Timeout**: Check AI provider API keys and network connectivity
2. **First-Party Extraction Fails**: Target website may block requests or be slow
3. **High Error Rates**: Monitor system health at `/api/healthz`
4. **Performance Degradation**: Check concurrent request limits and system resources

### Performance Optimization

- **Database Indexing**: Ensure proper indexes on frequently queried columns
- **AI Provider Limits**: Monitor rate limits and implement backoff strategies
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor HTML content extraction limits
- **Concurrent Requests**: Adjust limits based on system capacity
