## Testing Approach

### Test Structure
Each test file follows a consistent structure:
1. Import statements
2. Mock data definitions
3. Describe blocks for logical grouping
4. Individual test cases with clear assertions

### Mock Data
- Realistic mock data that represents actual use cases
- Edge cases covered (empty, zero, large values)
- All enum values tested (ratings, priorities, categories)

### Assertions
- Uses `@testing-library/react` best practices
- Tests user-visible behavior, not implementation details
- Checks for text content, visibility, and interactions

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all component tests
npm test -- client/src/components/__tests__

# Run specific test file
npm test -- client/src/components/__tests__/clonability-score-card.test.tsx

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch -- client/src/components/__tests__

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```

## Test Configuration

Tests use the existing Vitest configuration:
- **Environment:** jsdom (for DOM testing)
- **Setup File:** `client/src/test-setup.ts`
- **Globals:** Enabled
- **React Plugin:** Enabled for JSX support

## Notes

1. **Type Safety:** All tests use TypeScript with proper type definitions
2. **Best Practices:** Tests follow React Testing Library best practices
3. **Maintainability:** Clear test names and well-organized test suites
4. **Coverage:** Comprehensive coverage of all user-facing functionality
5. **Performance:** Tests run quickly with minimal setup/teardown

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for even more comprehensive testing:
1. Visual regression tests with screenshot comparisons
2. Accessibility tests with jest-axe
3. Performance tests for rendering large datasets
4. E2E tests with Playwright for full user flows
5. Snapshot tests for component structure

## Conclusion

Task 9.1 is complete with 127 comprehensive tests covering all UI components, user interactions, edge cases, and responsive behavior. All requirements have been verified and the test suite provides excellent coverage for the technology insights feature.
