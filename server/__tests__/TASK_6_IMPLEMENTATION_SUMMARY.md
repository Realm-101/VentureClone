# Task 6 Implementation Summary: Enhanced AI Prompts with Detected Tech Stack

## Overview
Successfully enhanced Stage 3 (MVP Planning) and Stage 6 (AI Automation) prompts to include detected technology stack information from Wappalyzer, providing AI with accurate technical context for better recommendations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Stage 3 (MVP Planning) Prompt Enhancement

**File**: `server/services/workflow.ts` - `getStage3Prompt()` method

**Key Changes**:
- Extract detected technologies from `analysis.structured.technical.actualDetected.technologies`
- Extract AI-inferred tech stack from `analysis.structured.technical.techStack`
- Extract complexity score from `analysis.structured.technical.complexityScore`
- Build comprehensive tech stack information string that includes:
  - Detected technologies with versions (e.g., "React 18.2.0, Next.js 13.4.1")
  - AI-inferred technologies (shown separately)
  - Technical complexity score (1-10 scale)
- Add new "TECHNOLOGY STACK ANALYSIS" section to prompt
- Add explicit instruction to AI: "IMPORTANT: When recommending a tech stack for the MVP, consider the detected technologies above"
- Update tech stack requirements to emphasize using detected technologies

**Example Output in Prompt**:
```
TECHNOLOGY STACK ANALYSIS:
Detected Technologies (via Wappalyzer): React 18.2.0, Next.js 13.4.1, Vercel
AI-Inferred Technologies: React, TypeScript
Technical Complexity Score: 6/10

IMPORTANT: When recommending a tech stack for the MVP, consider the detected technologies above...
```

### 2. Stage 6 (AI Automation) Prompt Enhancement

**File**: `server/services/workflow.ts` - `getStage6Prompt()` method

**Key Changes**:
- Extract detected technologies with categories
- Build comprehensive tech stack information including:
  - Detected technologies with versions
  - Technology categories (e.g., "CMS, Ecommerce, Analytics")
  - AI-inferred technologies (shown separately)
  - Technical complexity score
- Add new "TECHNOLOGY STACK ANALYSIS" section to prompt
- Add explicit instruction with platform-specific examples:
  - WordPress → WordPress-specific AI plugins
  - Shopify → Shopify AI apps and integrations
  - React/Next.js → JavaScript-based AI SDKs
  - Analytics tools → AI tools that integrate with them
- Update guidelines to emphasize matching automation recommendations to actual tech stack

**Example Output in Prompt**:
```
TECHNOLOGY STACK ANALYSIS:
Detected Technologies (via Wappalyzer): WordPress, WooCommerce, Google Analytics
Technology Categories: CMS, Blogs, Ecommerce, Analytics
AI-Inferred Technologies: WordPress
Technical Complexity Score: 4/10

IMPORTANT: When recommending AI automation tools and integrations, consider the detected technologies above...
```

## Fallback Handling

Both prompts implement graceful fallback:
1. **Best case**: Detected technologies available → Show detected + inferred + complexity
2. **Fallback 1**: Only AI-inferred available → Show inferred only
3. **Fallback 2**: No tech info available → Show "Unknown"

This ensures prompts work correctly regardless of whether Wappalyzer detection succeeded.

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 4.1 ✅
"WHEN Wappalyzer successfully detects technologies THEN the system SHALL include the actual tech stack in AI prompts for subsequent stages"
- Both Stage 3 and Stage 6 prompts include detected technologies

### Requirement 4.2 ✅
"WHEN generating Stage 3 (MVP Planning) recommendations THEN the AI SHALL use detected technologies to suggest compatible frameworks and tools"
- Added explicit instruction to consider detected technologies
- Updated tech stack requirements to emphasize using detected stack

### Requirement 4.3 ✅
"WHEN generating Stage 6 (AI Automation) recommendations THEN the AI SHALL consider the actual tech stack for integration suggestions"
- Added platform-specific automation guidance
- Emphasized matching automation tools to detected technologies

### Requirement 4.4 ✅
"WHEN Wappalyzer detection fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to using AI-inferred tech stack in prompts"
- Both prompts check for detected tech first, then fall back to inferred
- Handles missing data gracefully

### Requirement 4.5 ✅
"WHEN creating prompts THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between 'detected technologies' and 'inferred technologies'"
- Detected technologies labeled as "Detected Technologies (via Wappalyzer)"
- Inferred technologies labeled as "AI-Inferred Technologies"
- Clear separation in prompt output

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `server/__tests__/workflow-prompts.test.ts`:

### Stage 3 Tests:
1. ✅ Should include detected technologies in Stage 3 prompt
2. ✅ Should handle analysis with only AI-inferred tech stack
3. ✅ Should handle analysis with no tech stack information

### Stage 6 Tests:
1. ✅ Should include detected technologies in Stage 6 prompt
2. ✅ Should handle analysis with only AI-inferred tech stack

**All tests passing** ✅

## Impact

### For Users:
- More accurate MVP tech stack recommendations based on actual detected technologies
- Better AI automation suggestions that integrate with existing tech stack
- Clearer understanding of what technologies were detected vs. inferred

### For AI:
- Rich technical context for making recommendations
- Clear distinction between detected and inferred technologies
- Complexity score to guide recommendation sophistication
- Platform-specific guidance for automation tools

### For Developers:
- Maintainable code with clear fallback logic
- Comprehensive test coverage
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps

The following tasks remain in the tech detection integration:
- Task 7: Update UI components to display tech detection results
- Task 8: Add logging and monitoring
- Task 9: Add feature flag and deployment configuration
- Task 10: End-to-end testing and validation

## Files Modified

1. `server/services/workflow.ts` - Enhanced `getStage3Prompt()` and `getStage6Prompt()` methods
2. `server/__tests__/workflow-prompts.test.ts` - New test file with comprehensive test coverage

## Verification

Run tests:
```bash
npm test workflow-prompts.test.ts
```

All 5 tests pass successfully.
