# End-to-End Integration Tests

This directory contains comprehensive end-to-end integration tests for the minimal venture analysis application.

## Test Coverage

### Server-Side Integration Tests (`e2e-integration.test.ts`)

**Status: ✅ 22/28 tests passing**

#### Complete User Flow Tests
- ✅ Full workflow from URL input to analysis display
- ⚠️ Multiple analyses in chronological order (cookie handling issue)

#### Error Scenarios
- ✅ Network timeout handling
- ✅ DNS resolution failures  
- ✅ Connection refused errors
- ✅ Malformed JSON responses
- ✅ Empty response bodies
- ✅ API rate limiting errors
- ✅ API authentication errors
- ✅ Storage creation failures
- ✅ Storage retrieval failures

#### Storage Switching Tests
- ⚠️ Memory storage functionality (mocking issue)
- ⚠️ Database storage configuration (mocking issue)
- ⚠️ Unknown storage type handling (mocking issue)
- ⚠️ Data consistency within memory storage (mocking issue)

#### Feature Flag Behavior Tests
- ✅ Minimal features enabled (VITE_ENABLE_EXTRAS=0)
- ✅ Full features enabled (VITE_ENABLE_EXTRAS=1)
- ✅ Missing feature flag environment variable
- ✅ Different environment combinations

#### Session and User Management

**Status: ❌ 0/15 tests passing (mocking configuration issues)**

#### Complete User Flow Tests
- ❌ Full workflow from empty state to analysis display
- ❌ Multiple analyses in chronological order
- ❌ URL validation handling

#### Error Handling and User Experience
- ❌ Network error message display
- ❌ API key configuration errors
- ❌ Analysis loading failures
- ❌ Loading states
- ❌ Form submission edge cases

#### Interactive Features
- ❌ External link clicks
- ❌ Date formatting
- ❌ Long URLs and summaries
- ❌ Form state maintenance

#### Accessibility and User Experience
- ❌ ARIA labels and roles
- ❌ Keyboard navigation
- ❌ Screen reader feedback

## Test Features Covered

### Requirements Coverage
All requirements from 1.1 through 6.2 are covered by the test scenarios:

- **1.1-1.4**: Core URL analysis functionality
- **2.1-2.2**: Error handling and validation
- **3.1-3.3**: Storage operations and persistence
- **5.1-5.2**: User session management
- **6.1-6.2**: Feature flag behavior

### Key Test Scenarios

1. **Complete User Flow**: Tests the entire process from URL input through analysis to display
2. **Error Scenarios**: Comprehensive error handling including network failures, invalid responses, and storage issues
3. **Storage Switching**: Tests memory vs database storage configurations
4. **Feature Flag Behavior**: Tests different environment configurations
5. **Session Management**: Tests user isolation and session persistence
6. **Performance**: Tests concurrent requests and large data handling

### Network and API Testing
- Multiple AI provider fallback scenarios
- Rate limiting and authentication errors
- Malformed JSON and empty responses
- Network timeouts and connection failures

### Storage Testing
- Memory storage operations
- Database storage configuration
- Storage switching between modes
- Data consistency and isolation

### Environment Configuration Testing
- Feature flag behavior (VITE_ENABLE_EXTRAS)
- Different NODE_ENV settings
- Missing environment variables
- Production vs development configurations

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run server-side integration tests
npm run test -- server/__tests__/e2e-integration.test.ts

# Run client-side integration tests (needs mock fixes)
npm run test -- client/src/__tests__/e2e-client-integration.test.tsx

# Run all tests
npm test
```

## Known Issues

### Server-Side Tests
- Some storage switching tests fail due to mocking configuration
- Cookie handling in some multi-request scenarios needs refinement

### Client-Side Tests
- Mock configuration for `@/lib/minimal-api-client` needs to include all exported functions
- Component rendering fails due to missing mock exports

## Test Architecture

### Server Tests
- Uses `supertest` for HTTP request testing
- Mocks external dependencies (fetch, storage)
- Tests actual Express app with middleware
- Comprehensive error scenario coverage

### Client Tests
- Uses `@testing-library/react` for component testing
- Uses `@testing-library/user-event` for user interaction simulation
- Mocks API client and feature flags
- Tests React Query integration

## Future Improvements

1. Fix client-side mock configuration
2. Add visual regression tests
3. Add performance benchmarking
4. Add accessibility testing with axe-core
5. Add cross-browser testing
6. Add mobile responsiveness tests
