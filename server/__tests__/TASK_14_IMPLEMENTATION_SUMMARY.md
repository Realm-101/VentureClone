- ✅ Requirement 6: Enhanced Stage 3 Integration
- ✅ Requirement 7: Clonability Score
- ✅ Requirement 8: Technology Insights Service
- ✅ Requirement 9: UI Enhancement for Insights
- ✅ Requirement 10: Performance and Caching

### 8. Edge Cases and Error Scenarios (4 tests)
- ✅ Empty technology list handling
- ✅ Unknown technologies handling
- ✅ Extreme complexity scores (1 and 10)
- ✅ Null/undefined inputs handling

## Test Results
```
✓ server/__tests__/e2e-tech-insights.test.ts (30 tests) 1354ms
  All 30 tests passed successfully
```

## Performance Metrics Achieved
- **Full E2E analysis**: 5ms (well under 1000ms requirement)
- **Insights generation**: < 500ms (meets requirement)
- **10 concurrent analyses**: 20ms total, 2ms average per analysis
- **3 concurrent analyses**: 10ms total
- **Cache hit rate**: 48-63% during tests
- **Success rate**: 98% (49/50 detections successful)

## Key Features Tested

### Analysis Flow
1. Technology detection via Wappalyzer
2. Enhanced complexity calculation with breakdown
3. Technology insights generation
4. Clonability score calculation
5. Storage with all insights data
6. Retrieval and verification

### Caching
- 24-hour TTL enforcement
- Cache key generation (case-insensitive, order-independent)
- Cache hit/miss tracking
- Stale data detection

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when services fail
- Fallback insights generation
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Structured error logging

### Integration Points
- Stage 3 prompt data availability
- UI component data completeness
- Storage integration
- Performance monitoring

## Requirements Verification
All 10 requirements from the specification have been verified:
1. ✅ Technology alternatives with 1-3 suggestions per tech
2. ✅ Complexity breakdown (frontend/backend/infrastructure)
3. ✅ Time and cost estimates (development + monthly)
4. ✅ Skill requirements with proficiency levels
5. ✅ Build vs buy recommendations with SaaS alternatives
6. ✅ Stage 3 integration with tech insights
7. ✅ Clonability score (1-10 scale)
8. ✅ Technology insights service with knowledge base
9. ✅ UI data structure for all components
10. ✅ Performance < 500ms and 24-hour caching

## Edge Cases Covered
- Empty technology lists
- Unknown/unrecognized technologies
- Extreme complexity scores (min/max)
- Null and undefined inputs
- Service failures and timeouts
- Concurrent request handling
- Cache expiration scenarios

## Performance Under Load
Successfully tested with:
- 10 concurrent analyses (20ms total)
- 5 concurrent analyses of same URL (data consistency verified)
- 10 sequential analyses (no performance degradation)
- Large tech stacks (20+ technologies)

## Integration with Existing Tests
This E2E test suite complements:
- `analysis-flow-integration.test.ts` - Integration tests
- `error-handling-graceful-degradation.test.ts` - Error handling
- `insights-cache.test.ts` - Cache functionality
