## Performance Metrics

- **Detection Time**: < 15 seconds (with timeout)
- **Parallel Execution**: No increase in total workflow time
- **Success Rate**: Tracked via PerformanceMonitor
- **Fallback Rate**: Logged for monitoring
- **Slow Detection Threshold**: 10 seconds (warning logged)

## Security Features

- URL validation and sanitization
- Localhost blocking
- Private IP range blocking (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x)
- Protocol validation (HTTP/HTTPS only)
- URL length limits (2048 characters)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Enable/disable tech detection
ENABLE_TECH_DETECTION=true

# Existing variables remain unchanged
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key
GROK_API_KEY=your_key
```

### Feature Flag Usage
```typescript
// Tech detection is automatically disabled if flag is false
// Workflow falls back to AI-only analysis
if (process.env.ENABLE_TECH_DETECTION === 'true') {
  // Run tech detection
} else {
  // Skip tech detection, use AI only
}
```
