# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses critical bugs identified in the VentureClone AI application that are causing component crashes and test failures. The issues include null safety problems in the technology stack component, text mismatches between components and tests, and query issues in test files. These bugs impact application stability and test reliability, requiring immediate attention to ensure a robust user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Technology Stack Null Safety Issue

**User Story:** As a user analyzing a business, I want the technology stack component to handle missing category data gracefully, so that the application doesn't crash when rendering detected technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a technology object has undefined or null categories THEN the component SHALL handle it without throwing an error
2. WHEN rendering the technology stack THEN the component SHALL use optional chaining for the categories property
3. WHEN a technology lacks categories THEN the component SHALL skip that technology or assign it to a default category
4. WHEN the fix is implemented THEN existing functionality for technologies with valid categories SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 2: Resolve Component-Test Text Mismatches

**User Story:** As a developer running tests, I want test expectations to match actual component text, so that tests accurately validate component behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the estimates card component is rendered THEN it SHALL display consistent heading text that matches test expectations
2. WHEN the complexity breakdown component is rendered THEN it SHALL display consistent heading text that matches test expectations
3. IF the component text is "Resource Estimates" THEN tests SHALL expect "Resource Estimates" OR the component SHALL be updated to "Time & Cost Estimates"
4. IF the component text is "Complexity Analysis" THEN tests SHALL expect "Complexity Analysis" OR the component SHALL be updated to "Complexity Breakdown"
5. WHEN all text mismatches are resolved THEN the affected tests SHALL pass

### Requirement 3: Fix Skill Requirements Test Query Issues

**User Story:** As a developer running tests, I want skill requirements tests to correctly query elements that appear multiple times, so that tests run reliably without false failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing proficiency levels that appear multiple times THEN tests SHALL use getAllByText instead of getByText
2. WHEN multiple elements match a query THEN tests SHALL use more specific selectors or test IDs
3. WHEN querying for repeated text THEN tests SHALL handle arrays of elements appropriately
4. WHEN the fix is implemented THEN skill requirements tests SHALL pass consistently

### Requirement 4: Ensure Defensive Null Checking Throughout Components

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the application, I want all components to handle missing or undefined data gracefully, so that I never encounter unexpected crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component receives props with potentially undefined nested properties THEN it SHALL use optional chaining or null checks
2. WHEN rendering lists or arrays THEN components SHALL verify the data exists before iterating
3. WHEN accessing object properties THEN components SHALL use safe navigation patterns
4. WHEN defensive checks are added THEN component functionality SHALL remain unchanged for valid data

### Requirement 5: Maintain Test Coverage and Quality

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want all bug fixes to include corresponding test updates, so that regressions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing the null safety issue THEN tests SHALL be added or updated to verify the fix
2. WHEN updating component text THEN corresponding tests SHALL be updated in the same commit
3. WHEN fixing test queries THEN the tests SHALL verify correct component behavior
4. WHEN all fixes are complete THEN the test pass rate SHALL improve from 75.6% to at least 95%
