# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current tech detection integration successfully identifies technologies using Wappalyzer and calculates a basic complexity score. However, user feedback indicates the feature is disappointing because it provides raw data without actionable insights. Users see a list of technologies and a complexity number, but don't understand what it means for their cloning effort.

This enhancement transforms tech detection from a data display feature into an actionable insights engine. Instead of just showing "React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Complexity: 6/10", we'll provide concrete recommendations like "Estimated clone time: 3-6 months, Cost: $5K-15K, Consider using Supabase instead of custom PostgreSQL backend to save 2 months."

The enhancement focuses on three key areas:
1. **Actionable Recommendations** - Suggest alternatives, simplifications, and build-vs-buy decisions
2. **Business Context** - Translate technical complexity into time, cost, and skill requirements
3. **Workflow Integration** - Use tech insights to improve Stage 3 (MVP Planning) and Stage 6 (AI Automation) recommendations

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Technology Alternative Recommendations

**User Story:** As a VentureClone user, I want to see simpler alternatives to detected technologies, so that I can make informed decisions about which technologies to use for my clone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a technology is detected THEN the system SHALL suggest 1-3 alternative technologies that are simpler or more suitable for MVPs
2. WHEN suggesting alternatives THEN the system SHALL include the alternative name, difficulty level (beginner/intermediate/advanced), and a brief reason for the suggestion
3. WHEN a no-code platform is detected (Webflow, Shopify) THEN the system SHALL recommend using the same platform for fastest time-to-market
4. WHEN a complex custom solution is detected (custom CMS, custom auth) THEN the system SHALL suggest modern SaaS alternatives (Contentful, Clerk, Auth0)
5. WHEN displaying alternatives THEN the UI SHALL show estimated time savings and complexity reduction for each alternative

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Complexity Breakdown

**User Story:** As a VentureClone user, I want to understand what contributes to the complexity score, so that I can identify which areas are most challenging to clone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complexity is calculated THEN the system SHALL break down the score into component parts: frontend (0-3 points), backend (0-4 points), infrastructure (0-3 points)
2. WHEN displaying complexity THEN the UI SHALL show a visual breakdown with each component's contribution
3. WHEN calculating complexity THEN the system SHALL consider the total number of technologies (more technologies = higher complexity)
4. WHEN calculating complexity THEN the system SHALL weight technologies by category importance (backend > frontend > analytics)
5. WHEN a technology has licensing restrictions THEN the system SHALL add +1 to complexity score and flag it in the breakdown

### Requirement 3: Time and Cost Estimates

**User Story:** As a VentureClone user, I want to see estimated time and cost to clone the detected tech stack, so that I can assess if the project is feasible for my resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN technologies are detected THEN the system SHALL calculate an estimated clone time range in months (e.g., "3-6 months")
2. WHEN calculating time estimates THEN the system SHALL assume a solo developer working part-time (10-20 hours/week)
3. WHEN technologies are detected THEN the system SHALL calculate estimated monthly infrastructure cost (e.g., "$50-200/month")
4. WHEN calculating costs THEN the system SHALL include hosting, databases, third-party services, and SaaS tools
5. WHEN displaying estimates THEN the UI SHALL show both one-time development costs and ongoing monthly costs

### Requirement 4: Skill Requirements Analysis

**User Story:** As a VentureClone user, I want to know what skills are required to clone the detected tech stack, so that I can assess if I have the necessary expertise or need to hire.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN technologies are detected THEN the system SHALL identify required skills with proficiency levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
2. WHEN displaying skills THEN the UI SHALL group them by category (frontend, backend, infrastructure, design)
3. WHEN a skill is identified THEN the system SHALL provide links to 2-3 high-quality learning resources
4. WHEN multiple technologies require the same skill THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single skill requirement
5. WHEN displaying skills THEN the UI SHALL highlight which skills are most critical for the MVP

### Requirement 5: Build vs Buy Recommendations

**User Story:** As a VentureClone user, I want recommendations on whether to build custom solutions or use existing services, so that I can minimize development time and complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a custom solution is detected (custom auth, custom CMS, custom payment processing) THEN the system SHALL recommend equivalent SaaS alternatives
2. WHEN recommending SaaS alternatives THEN the system SHALL include service name, pricing tier, and estimated time savings
3. WHEN comparing build vs buy THEN the system SHALL show tradeoffs: development time, monthly cost, flexibility, and maintenance burden
4. WHEN a technology is commonly available as a service THEN the system SHALL default to recommending the service over custom development
5. WHEN displaying recommendations THEN the UI SHALL clearly indicate which approach is recommended for MVP and which for scale

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Stage 3 Integration

**User Story:** As a VentureClone user, I want Stage 3 (MVP Planning) to use detected technologies to provide better tech stack recommendations, so that I receive guidance aligned with the original business's proven approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating Stage 3 recommendations THEN the AI SHALL reference detected technologies and explain why they were chosen by the original business
2. WHEN detected technologies are complex THEN the AI SHALL suggest simpler alternatives for the MVP with clear reasoning
3. WHEN detected technologies are well-suited for MVPs THEN the AI SHALL recommend using the same stack
4. WHEN generating tech stack recommendations THEN the AI SHALL include estimated development time based on detected complexity
5. WHEN displaying Stage 3 results THEN the UI SHALL show a side-by-side comparison of "Original Stack" vs "Recommended MVP Stack"

### Requirement 7: Clonability Score

**User Story:** As a VentureClone user, I want a single clonability score that combines technical complexity with business factors, so that I can quickly assess if a business is worth cloning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL calculate a clonability score from 1-10 (10 = easiest to clone)
2. WHEN calculating clonability THEN the system SHALL combine technical complexity (40%), market opportunity (30%), resource requirements (20%), and time-to-market (10%)
3. WHEN clonability is low (1-3) THEN the system SHALL recommend against cloning and suggest finding simpler opportunities
4. WHEN clonability is medium (4-7) THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations to improve feasibility
5. WHEN clonability is high (8-10) THEN the system SHALL highlight this as a strong opportunity and provide fast-track recommendations

### Requirement 8: Technology Insights Service

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized service that provides technology insights and recommendations, so that the system can deliver consistent, high-quality guidance across all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load a technology knowledge base with information about 100+ common technologies
2. WHEN a technology is queried THEN the service SHALL return alternatives, difficulty level, typical use cases, and learning resources
3. WHEN calculating estimates THEN the service SHALL use a consistent formula based on technology complexity and quantity
4. WHEN the knowledge base is updated THEN the system SHALL NOT require code changes to reflect new technology information
5. WHEN a technology is not in the knowledge base THEN the service SHALL provide generic recommendations based on category

### Requirement 9: UI Enhancement for Insights

**User Story:** As a VentureClone user, I want the technology analysis UI to prioritize insights over raw data, so that I can quickly understand what actions to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing technology analysis THEN the UI SHALL show actionable insights prominently at the top (recommendations, estimates, alternatives)
2. WHEN viewing technology analysis THEN the UI SHALL collapse detailed technology lists into an expandable section
3. WHEN displaying recommendations THEN the UI SHALL use visual indicators (icons, colors, badges) to highlight key insights
4. WHEN a user hovers over a recommendation THEN the UI SHALL show additional context and reasoning
5. WHEN displaying alternatives THEN the UI SHALL provide one-click actions to "Use this alternative in MVP planning"

### Requirement 10: Performance and Caching

**User Story:** As a VentureClone user, I want technology insights to load quickly, so that I don't experience delays when viewing analysis results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN technology insights are generated THEN the system SHALL cache results for 24 hours
2. WHEN the same URL is analyzed multiple times THEN the system SHALL reuse cached technology insights
3. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL complete within 500ms (excluding initial tech detection)
