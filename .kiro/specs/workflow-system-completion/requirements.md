# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses the completion of the 6-stage workflow system for VentureClone AI. Currently, only Stage 1 (Discovery & Selection) is fully functional. This feature will implement the remaining 5 stages with AI-generated content, stage progression logic, and proper data persistence.

**Context**: The application successfully analyzes businesses and generates scores, but the workflow stages 2-6 are not implemented. Users see the stage UI but cannot progress through the workflow or generate stage-specific content.

**Goal**: Complete the 6-stage workflow system to provide users with a systematic process from business discovery through AI automation planning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Stage 2 - Lazy-Entrepreneur Filter

**User Story:** As an entrepreneur, I want to evaluate if a business opportunity is worth pursuing with minimal effort, so that I can focus on high-reward, low-effort opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Generate Lazy-Entrepreneur Filter" on an analyzed business THEN the system SHALL generate effort vs. reward analysis
2. WHEN the filter is generated THEN the system SHALL provide a go/no-go recommendation based on effort analysis
3. WHEN the filter is complete THEN the system SHALL display effort score, automation potential, and resource requirements
4. IF the analysis lacks sufficient data THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message
5. WHEN the filter is saved THEN the system SHALL update the analysis record with stage 2 data

### Requirement 2: Stage 3 - MVP Launch Planning

**User Story:** As an entrepreneur, I want to define my minimum viable product, so that I can launch quickly and validate the market.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user progresses to Stage 3 THEN the system SHALL generate MVP feature recommendations
2. WHEN MVP planning is generated THEN the system SHALL identify core features vs. nice-to-haves
3. WHEN the plan is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a tech stack recommendation
4. WHEN the plan is complete THEN the system SHALL estimate development timeline
5. WHEN the plan is saved THEN the system SHALL update the analysis record with stage 3 data

### Requirement 3: Stage 4 - Demand Testing Strategy

**User Story:** As an entrepreneur, I want to test market demand before building, so that I can validate the business idea with minimal investment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user progresses to Stage 4 THEN the system SHALL generate demand testing strategies

3. WHEN the strategy is complete THEN the system SHALL provide success metrics and KPIs
4. WHEN the strategy is complete THEN the system SHALL estimate testing budget and timeline
5. WHEN the strategy is saved THEN the system SHALL update the analysis record with stage 4 data

### Requirement 4: Stage 5 - Scaling & Growth Planning

**User Story:** As an entrepreneur, I want to plan for growth after validation, so that I can scale the business systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user progresses to Stage 5 THEN the system SHALL generate scaling strategies

4. WHEN the plan is complete THEN the system SHALL estimate growth timeline and milestones
5. WHEN the plan is saved THEN the system SHALL update the analysis record with stage 5 data

### Requirement 5: Stage 6 - AI Automation Mapping

**User Story:** As an entrepreneur, I want to identify automation opportunities, so that I can reduce operational overhead and increase efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user progresses to Stage 6 THEN the system SHALL identify automation opportunities
2. WHEN the mapping is generated THEN the system SHALL recommend specific AI tools and services
3. WHEN the mapping is complete THEN the system SHALL estimate automation ROI
4. WHEN the mapping is complete THEN the system SHALL provide implementation priority
5. WHEN the mapping is saved THEN the system SHALL update the analysis record with stage 6 data

### Requirement 6: Workflow Progression System

**User Story:** As an entrepreneur, I want to progress through stages sequentially, so that I follow a systematic approach to business validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a stage THEN the system SHALL unlock the next stage
2. WHEN a user views the workflow THEN the system SHALL show current progress and completed stages
3. WHEN a user tries to skip ahead THEN the system SHALL require previous stages to be completed
4. IF a user wants to regenerate a stage THEN the system SHALL allow re-generation without losing other stage data
5. WHEN all stages are complete THEN the system SHALL mark the analysis as "Complete"

### Requirement 7: Stage Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my workflow progress to be saved, so that I can return later and continue where I left off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a stage is generated THEN the system SHALL save the stage data to the analysis record
2. WHEN a user returns to an analysis THEN the system SHALL load all previously generated stage data
3. WHEN stage data is updated THEN the system SHALL preserve the original creation timestamp
4. IF storage fails THEN the system SHALL return an error and not lose the generated content
5. WHEN listing analyses THEN the system SHALL include stage completion status

### Requirement 8: API Endpoints for Stage Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want RESTful endpoints for stage generation, so that the frontend can request stage-specific content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN POST /api/business-analyses/:id/stages/:stageNumber is called THEN the system SHALL generate content for that stage
2. WHEN GET /api/business-analyses/:id/stages is called THEN the system SHALL return all stage data for an analysis
3. WHEN the stage number is invalid THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error
4. WHEN the analysis doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return a 429 error

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages when stage generation fails, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI generation fails THEN the system SHALL return a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN API timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest retry
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL specify which data is missing or invalid
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL distinguish between client and server issues
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging

### Requirement 10: Stage Content Quality

**User Story:** As an entrepreneur, I want high-quality, actionable stage content, so that I can make informed decisions about my business.
