## 11.1 Test Stage Generation with Real Analyses ✅

### Implementation

Created comprehensive integration tests in `server/__tests__/workflow-integration.test.ts` that cover:

1. **Stage 2 (Lazy-Entrepreneur Filter) Testing**
   - Validates prompt generation includes all required fields
   - Tests AI content generation with real API calls
   - Verifies data structure and types
   - Validates scoring ranges (effortScore 1-10, rewardScore 1-10, automationScore 0-1)
   - Checks recommendation values ('go', 'no-go', 'maybe')
   - Ensures arrays and objects are properly populated

2. **Stage 3 (MVP Launch Planning) Testing**
   - Validates prompt generation with Stage 2 context
   - Tests core features and nice-to-haves arrays
   - Verifies tech stack structure (frontend, backend, infrastructure)
   - Validates timeline phases with deliverables
   - Checks cost estimation format

3. **Stage Progression Testing**
   - Tests stage 1 is always accessible
   - Validates stage 2 is accessible after stage 1 completion
   - Ensures stage 3 is blocked until stage 2 is complete
   - Tests completed stages tracking
   - Validates current stage calculation

4. **Error Handling Testing**
   - Tests invalid stage numbers (0, 7)
   - Tests non-existent analysis handling
   - Validates stage data structure validation
   - Tests empty and null data rejection

### Test Coverage

## 11.3 Add Error Recovery ✅

### Implementation

Created comprehensive error recovery system in `server/lib/retry.ts`:

#### 1. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

**Features:**
- Configurable max attempts (default: 3)
- Exponential backoff with configurable multiplier (default: 2x)
- Maximum delay cap (default: 10 seconds)
- Retry attempt callbacks for logging
- Total time tracking

**Retryable Error Detection:**
Automatically detects and retries:
- Timeout errors (ETIMEDOUT, timeout, DEADLINE_EXCEEDED)
- Network errors (ECONNRESET, ECONNREFUSED, ENOTFOUND, network)
- Rate limit errors (429, rate limit, quota, RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED)
- Server errors (502, 503, 504)

**Non-Retryable Errors:**
Fails immediately for:
- API key errors (401, unauthorized)
- Validation errors (schema, invalid)
- Configuration errors

#### 2. Partial Result Handling

**Features:**
- Saves partial AI responses during generation
- Prevents data loss on failure
- In-memory cache for quick recovery
- Automatic cleanup on success

**Use Case:**
If AI generation partially succeeds but validation fails, the partial result is saved and can be inspected for debugging.

#### 3. User-Friendly Error Guidance

**generateErrorGuidance() Function:**
Provides context-specific guidance for each error type:

- **Timeout Errors:**
  - User message: "AI service took too long to respond"
  - Next steps: Wait 1-2 minutes, automatic retry with longer timeout
  - Estimated wait: 1-2 minutes
  - Retryable: Yes

- **Rate Limit Errors:**
  - User message: "Rate limit reached, temporary"
  - Next steps: Wait 5-10 minutes, limits reset automatically
  - Estimated wait: 5-10 minutes
  - Retryable: Yes

- **Network Errors:**
  - User message: "Network error connecting to AI service"
  - Next steps: Check connection, try again
  - Estimated wait: 30 seconds
  - Retryable: Yes

- **API Key Errors:**
  - User message: "AI service configuration issue"
  - Next steps: Contact support
  - Retryable: No

- **Validation Errors:**
  - User message: "AI returned invalid data"
  - Next steps: Try again for new response
  - Estimated wait: 30 seconds
  - Retryable: Yes

#### 4. Integration with Stage Generation

**Updated `server/routes.ts`:**
- Wrapped AI generation in `retryWithBackoff()`
- Saves partial results during generation
- Provides detailed error metadata
- Returns user-friendly error messages with next steps
- Logs retry attempts and timing

**Error Response Format:**
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to generate Stage 2 content after 3 attempts",
  "code": "AI_PROVIDER_DOWN",
  "userMessage": "The AI service took too long to respond...",
  "metadata": {
    "stageNumber": 2,
    "analysisId": "abc123",
    "attempts": 3,
    "totalTimeMs": 45000,
    "nextSteps": [
      "Wait 1-2 minutes and try again",
      "The system will automatically retry with a longer timeout"
    ],
    "retryable": true,
    "estimatedWaitTime": "1-2 minutes"
  }
}
```

### Benefits

1. **Resilience**: Automatically recovers from transient failures
2. **User Experience**: Clear, actionable error messages
3. **Data Safety**: Partial results saved to prevent data loss
4. **Debugging**: Detailed error metadata for troubleshooting
5. **Performance**: Exponential backoff prevents overwhelming services

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Generate Stage 2 for a real business analysis
- [ ] Verify Stage 2 content is business-specific and actionable
- [ ] Try to skip to Stage 4 (should fail with clear message)
- [ ] Complete stages 2-6 sequentially
- [ ] Regenerate Stage 3 (should work without affecting other stages)
- [ ] Verify all data persists after browser refresh
- [ ] Test with different AI providers (Gemini, Grok, OpenAI)
- [ ] Simulate timeout by reducing timeout value
- [ ] Verify retry logic works (check console logs)
- [ ] Verify error messages are user-friendly

### Automated Testing

Run the integration tests:
```bash
npm test -- --run server/__tests__/workflow-integration.test.ts
```

Note: Tests require AI provider API keys to be configured.
