# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the reliability, observability, and robustness of the VentureClone AI platform. The improvements include fixing storage correctness issues, adding request timeouts and rate limiting, implementing health checks, and enhancing the analysis output with structured data. These changes will make the platform more production-ready and provide better error handling and monitoring capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want consistent error responses and stable data operations, so that the system behaves predictably and debugging is easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API error occurs THEN the system SHALL return a consistent JSON response format with `{ error: string }` structure
2. WHEN listing analyses multiple times THEN the system SHALL return the same sorted order without mutating internal storage state
3. WHEN storage operations are performed THEN the system SHALL not modify the original data structures in place
4. IF an error has a status code THEN the system SHALL return that status code, otherwise default to 500

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want request timeouts and rate limiting, so that the system is protected from hung requests and abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making external API calls THEN the system SHALL timeout after 15 seconds maximum
2. WHEN a request times out THEN the system SHALL return a proper error response instead of hanging
3. WHEN users exceed rate limits THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 with appropriate error message
4. WHEN requests are made THEN the system SHALL include unique request IDs for traceability
5. IF a user makes more than 20 requests in 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL block additional requests with rate limit error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want a health check endpoint, so that I can monitor system status and deployment success.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the health endpoint THEN the system SHALL return current environment status
2. WHEN checking health THEN the system SHALL indicate which AI providers are configured
3. WHEN health is checked THEN the system SHALL show storage type and environment information
4. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL include build/commit information if available
5. IF API keys are missing THEN the health check SHALL indicate which providers are unavailable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced analysis output with structured data, so that I can get more detailed and organized business insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a business THEN the system SHALL attempt to generate structured analysis data
2. WHEN structured analysis succeeds THEN the system SHALL store both structured data and readable summary
3. WHEN structured analysis fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to plain text summary without breaking
4. WHEN structured data is available THEN the summary SHALL be formatted from the structured content
5. IF the AI model returns malformed JSON THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and continue
6. WHEN storing analysis THEN the system SHALL include structured data field when available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper middleware organization and request handling, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL apply middleware in correct order
2. WHEN rate limiting is needed THEN the system SHALL use dedicated middleware components
3. WHEN handling timeouts THEN the system SHALL use reusable utility functions
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL assign unique request IDs
5. IF middleware fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing
