# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements essential hardening measures for the VentureClone AI application to improve reliability, prevent abuse, and enhance operability. The hardening focuses on request timeouts, rate limiting, health checks, data integrity, and basic CI/CD without bloating the minimal scope of the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want AI provider calls to timeout gracefully so that I don't experience indefinite loading states when external services are unresponsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI provider call takes longer than 8 seconds THEN the system SHALL abort the request and return a clean JSON error response
2. WHEN a timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL return a 502 status code with error code "GATEWAY_TIMEOUT"
3. WHEN a timeout occurs THEN the response SHALL include a request ID for debugging purposes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want basic rate limiting on analysis endpoints so that the application is protected from abuse and resource exhaustion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes more than 10 requests to /analyze within 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL return a 429 status code
2. WHEN rate limiting is triggered THEN the system SHALL return error code "RATE_LIMITED" with a descriptive message
3. WHEN rate limiting is applied THEN it SHALL be based on a combination of IP address and user identifier
4. WHEN the rate limit window expires THEN users SHALL be able to make requests again

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a health check endpoint so that I can monitor the application status and verify deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call GET /api/healthz THEN the system SHALL return a JSON response with "ok: true"
2. WHEN I call the health endpoint THEN it SHALL indicate the storage mode (memory or database)
3. WHEN I call the health endpoint THEN it SHALL show which AI providers are configured with API keys
4. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN it SHALL respond quickly without performing expensive operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want storage operations to be non-mutating so that internal data structures remain consistent and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN listAnalyses is called THEN it SHALL return a sorted copy of the data without modifying the original array
2. WHEN multiple concurrent reads occur THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other
3. WHEN data is retrieved THEN the original storage structure SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling with request tracking so that debugging and monitoring are improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL return a consistent JSON error format
2. WHEN an error response is sent THEN it SHALL include a unique request ID
3. WHEN errors are handled THEN they SHALL include appropriate HTTP status codes and error codes
4. WHEN a request is processed THEN it SHALL have a unique identifier for tracing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI checks so that code quality is maintained and regressions are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main or rescue-min branches THEN CI SHALL run automatically
2. WHEN a pull request is created THEN CI SHALL run type checking and tests
3. WHEN CI runs THEN it SHALL perform TypeScript type checking without emitting files
4. WHEN CI runs THEN it SHALL execute the test suite and report results
5. WHEN CI fails THEN the build status SHALL be clearly indicated
