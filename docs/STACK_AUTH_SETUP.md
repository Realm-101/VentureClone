# Stack Auth Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Stack Auth for VentureClone AI, providing complete authentication with email/password, email verification, and user profiles.

## Prerequisites

- A Stack Auth account (free tier available)
- Your Neon database is already configured with the `neon_auth` schema

## Step 1: Create a Stack Auth Project

1. Go to [Stack Auth Dashboard](https://app.stack-auth.com/)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click "Create New Project"
4. Name your project (e.g., "VentureClone AI")
5. Select your preferred authentication methods:
   - âœ… Email/Password (recommended)
   - âœ… Magic Link (optional)
   - âœ… Google OAuth (optional)
   - âœ… GitHub OAuth (optional)

## Step 2: Get Your Credentials

After creating your project, you'll see three important credentials:

1. **Project ID** - Used by both frontend and backend
2. **Publishable Client Key** - Used by frontend (safe to expose)
3. **Secret Server Key** - Used by backend (keep secret!)

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Copy your `.env.example` to `.env` if you haven't already:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Add your Stack Auth credentials to `.env`:

```env
# Stack Auth Configuration
VITE_STACK_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
VITE_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY=your_publishable_key_here
STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

## Step 4: Configure Stack Auth Settings

In your Stack Auth dashboard:

### 4.1 Set Allowed Domains

Go to **Settings â†’ Domains** and add:
- `http://localhost:5000` (for development)
- Your production domain (e.g., `https://yourapp.com`)

### 4.2 Configure Redirect URLs

Go to **Settings â†’ URLs** and set:
- **Sign In URL**: `/handler/sign-in`
- **Sign Up URL**: `/handler/sign-up`
- **After Sign In**: `/home`
- **After Sign Up**: `/home`
- **After Sign Out**: `/`

### 4.3 Enable Email Verification (Optional but Recommended)

Go to **Settings â†’ Email** and:
- Enable email verification
- Customize email templates if desired
- Configure your email provider (Stack provides a default)

## Step 5: Initialize Stack Auth

Run this command to set up Stack Auth in your project:

```bash
npx @stackframe/init-stack . --no-browser
```

This command will:
- âœ… Add `@stackframe/stack` to your dependencies (already done)
- âœ… Create Stack configuration files (already done)
- âœ… Set up authentication routes (already done)

## Step 6: Test Your Setup

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

3. You should see a "Sign In" button in the header

4. Click it and try:
   - Creating a new account
   - Signing in with email/password
   - Viewing your profile at `/profile`

## Features Included

### âœ… Authentication
- Email/password sign up and sign in
- Email verification
- Password reset
- Session management with cookies

### âœ… User Profile
- View profile information
- Display name and email
- Profile picture (if uploaded)
- Account creation date
- Sign out functionality

### âœ… Protected Routes
- Home page requires authentication
- Automatic redirect to sign-in for unauthenticated users
- Seamless user experience

### âœ… UI Components
- Pre-built sign-in/sign-up forms
- User avatar in header
- Profile page
- Responsive design

## Database Integration

Stack Auth automatically syncs user data to your Neon database in the `neon_auth.users_sync` table. This allows you to:

- Query user data in your application
- Create relationships with other tables
- Maintain data consistency

Example query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM neon_auth.users_sync;
```

## Customization

### Custom Sign-In Page

To customize the sign-in experience, edit:
- `client/src/pages/handler.tsx` - Auth handler component
- Use Stack's built-in components or create custom forms

### Profile Page

Customize the profile page at:
- `client/src/pages/profile.tsx`

### User Menu

Modify the header user menu at:
- `client/src/components/user-menu.tsx`

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid credentials" error
- Double-check your environment variables
- Ensure you copied the correct keys from Stack Auth dashboard
- Restart your dev server after changing `.env`

### Redirect loop
- Verify your redirect URLs in Stack Auth dashboard
- Check that `VITE_STACK_PROJECT_ID` is set correctly

### Email verification not working
- Check your email provider settings in Stack Auth
- Look for verification emails in spam folder
- Ensure email verification is enabled in Stack Auth settings

### User not redirected after sign-in
- Verify `afterSignIn` URL in `stack/server.ts`
- Check browser console for errors

## Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:

1. âœ… Add your production domain to Stack Auth allowed domains
2. âœ… Set production environment variables on your hosting platform
3. âœ… Enable HTTPS (required for secure cookies)
4. âœ… Test authentication flow in production
5. âœ… Configure email provider for production emails

## Security Best Practices

- âœ… Never commit `.env` file to version control
- âœ… Use different Stack Auth projects for dev/staging/production
- âœ… Rotate secret keys periodically
- âœ… Enable email verification for production
- âœ… Use HTTPS in production
- âœ… Set secure cookie settings (already configured)
