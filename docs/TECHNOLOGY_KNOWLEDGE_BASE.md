## Usage in the System

### Loading Process

The knowledge base is loaded on server startup:

```typescript
// server/services/technology-knowledge-base.ts
export class TechnologyKnowledgeBase {
  private technologies: Map<string, TechnologyProfile>;

  constructor() {
    this.technologies = new Map();
    this.loadKnowledgeBase();
  }

  private loadKnowledgeBase(): void {
    const data = JSON.parse(
      fs.readFileSync(
        path.join(__dirname, '../data/technology-knowledge-base.json'),
        'utf-8'
      )
    );
    
    for (const tech of data.technologies) {
      this.technologies.set(tech.name.toLowerCase(), tech);
    }
  }
}
```

### Lookup Performance

- **Data Structure**: HashMap for O(1) lookups
- **Memory Footprint**: ~50KB for 50+ technologies
- **Lookup Time**: <1ms per technology
- **Cache**: Loaded once on startup, kept in memory

### Fallback Behavior

When a technology is not found:

1. **Log Missing Technology**: Record for future addition
2. **Provide Generic Recommendations**: Based on category
3. **Continue Processing**: Don't fail the entire analysis
4. **Return Partial Insights**: Use available data

Example fallback:

```typescript
getTechnology(name: string): TechnologyProfile | null {
  const profile = this.technologies.get(name.toLowerCase());
  
  if (!profile) {
    console.warn(`Technology not found in knowledge base: ${name}`);
    return this.getGenericProfile(name);
  }
  
  return profile;
}
```

## Integration with Insights Engine

The knowledge base powers multiple features:

### 1. Technology Alternatives

```typescript
// Generate alternatives for each detected technology
for (const tech of detectedTechnologies) {
  const profile = knowledgeBase.getTechnology(tech.name);
  if (profile?.alternatives) {
    insights.alternatives.push(...profile.alternatives);
  }
}
```

### 2. Build vs Buy Analysis

```typescript
// Identify custom solutions and suggest SaaS alternatives
for (const tech of detectedTechnologies) {
  const profile = knowledgeBase.getTechnology(tech.name);
  if (profile?.saasAlternatives?.length > 0) {
    insights.buildVsBuy.push({
      customSolution: tech.name,
      saasAlternatives: profile.saasAlternatives
    });
  }
}
```

### 3. Skill Requirements

```typescript
// Map technologies to required skills
const skills = new Map<string, SkillRequirement>();

for (const tech of detectedTechnologies) {
  const profile = knowledgeBase.getTechnology(tech.name);
  const category = profile?.category || 'other';
  
  if (!skills.has(category)) {
    skills.set(category, {
      category,
      technologies: [],
      proficiency: profile?.difficulty || 'intermediate',
      learningResources: profile?.learningResources || []
    });
  }
}
```

### 4. Cost Estimation

```typescript
// Calculate total development time and costs
let totalDevHours = 0;
let totalMonthlyCost = 0;

for (const tech of detectedTechnologies) {
  const profile = knowledgeBase.getTechnology(tech.name);
  if (profile?.estimatedCost) {
    totalDevHours += (profile.estimatedCost.development.min + 
                      profile.estimatedCost.development.max) / 2;
    totalMonthlyCost += (profile.estimatedCost.monthly.min + 
                         profile.estimatedCost.monthly.max) / 2;
  }
}
```

## Validation

### Schema Validation

The knowledge base includes validation on load:

```typescript
private validateProfile(profile: any): boolean {
  const required = ['name', 'category', 'difficulty', 'popularity', 
                    'maturity', 'licensing'];
  
  for (const field of required) {
    if (!profile[field]) {
      console.error(`Missing required field: ${field} in ${profile.name}`);
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

### Testing

Run tests to verify knowledge base integrity:

```bash
npm test -- technology-knowledge-base.test.ts
```

Tests verify:
- All entries have required fields
- Categories are valid
- Difficulty levels are valid
- URLs in learning resources are accessible
- Cost estimates are reasonable
- Alternatives reference valid technologies
