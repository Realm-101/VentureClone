# ðŸš€ Push Your Changes Now!

## The Issue

Render is building from an **old commit** that still has Stack Auth references.

Your **local code is correct** - main.tsx has no Stack Auth imports.

## Solution: Push Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Remove Stack Auth completely, add custom authentication"
git push
```

## What This Will Do

1. âœ… Commit all your local changes
2. âœ… Push to your repository
3. âœ… Trigger a new Render build
4. âœ… Build will succeed (no Stack Auth)

## Verify Before Pushing

Check that these files are clean:

```bash
# Should have NO Stack Auth imports
git diff client/src/main.tsx
git diff client/src/App.tsx
git diff client/src/components/user-menu.tsx
```

## After Pushing

1. Watch Render build logs
2. Build should complete in ~2 minutes
3. No Stack Auth errors
4. App deploys successfully

## If Build Still Fails

Check that:
- âœ… Changes were actually pushed (`git log`)
- âœ… Render is building from correct branch
- âœ… No cached node_modules (Render should clear automatically)

## Environment Variables

Don't forget to set on Render:

```env
SESSION_SECRET=<generate-random-string>
```

Generate it:
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

## Ready?

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Remove Stack Auth, add custom authentication"
git push
```

**Then watch Render deploy successfully!** ðŸŽ‰
