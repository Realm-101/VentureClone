**Performance**: <500ms insights generation with 24-hour caching

### 2. Enhanced Complexity Analysis

Replaces simple 1-10 scoring with detailed breakdown:

- **Frontend Complexity** (0-3): UI frameworks, state management, styling
- **Backend Complexity** (0-4): Server frameworks, APIs, authentication, databases
- **Infrastructure Complexity** (0-3): Hosting, CDN, monitoring, scaling

**Weighted Scoring**: Frontend (30%), Backend (50%), Infrastructure (20%)

### 3. Comprehensive Clonability Score

New 1-10 scoring system combining multiple factors:

- **Technical Complexity** (40%): How hard to build
- **Market Opportunity** (30%): Market size and competition
- **Resource Requirements** (20%): Team size and skills needed
- **Time to Market** (10%): How quickly can you launch

**Output**: Clear rating (very-easy to very-difficult) with actionable recommendation

### 4. Technology Knowledge Base

Curated database of 50+ technology profiles including:

- Alternatives with time savings
- Development and operational costs
- Learning resources with difficulty levels
- Popularity and maturity indicators
- Licensing information

**Extensibility**: Easy to add new technologies via JSON file

### 5. Enhanced UI Components

New React components for displaying insights:

- **ClonabilityScoreCard**: Visual score display with breakdown
- **ComplexityBreakdown**: Detailed complexity analysis by category
- **TechnologyStack**: Interactive tech stack with alternatives
- **SkillRequirementsSection**: Required skills with learning resources

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

No new environment variables required. Existing `ENABLE_TECH_DETECTION` flag controls the entire feature.

### Feature Flags

- `ENABLE_TECH_DETECTION=true`: Enables tech detection and insights (default)
- `ENABLE_TECH_DETECTION=false`: Disables feature, falls back to AI-only analysis

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Benchmarks

- **Insights Generation**: <500ms (excluding tech detection)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >80% for repeated analyses
- **Knowledge Base Lookups**: <1ms per technology
- **Total Analysis Time**: <10% increase vs AI-only

### Resource Usage

- **Memory**: +50KB for knowledge base
- **Storage**: +5KB per analysis (insights data)
- **CPU**: Minimal impact (<5% increase)

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### For Existing Deployments

1. **Update Code**: Pull latest changes from repository
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install`
3. **Build Application**: Run `npm run build`
4. **Restart Server**: No database migrations required
